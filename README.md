# backendbookclub
Git hub repositort: https://github.com/elishamjco/backendbookclub.git

To run project, run server in manage.py

Users can make accounts, book clubs, books, edit and delete books as well as edit and delete clubs. Reviews can be made but wont appear, unfortunatley I wasnt able to implement every feature.
